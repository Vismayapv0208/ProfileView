*   **Kotlin Flow:**
    *   **Reason:** Provides a reactive stream API for handling asynchronous data streams, making it easier to manage complex asynchronous operations.
    *   **Implementation:** Used in the ViewModel and repository to handle network requests and data updates.
*   **Hilt for Dependency Injection:**
    *   **Reason:** Simplifies dependency management and reduces boilerplate code.
    *   **Implementation:** Used to inject dependencies into classes, making the code more modular and testable.
*   **RecyclerView:**
    *   **Reason:** Efficiently displays large lists of data, and it's highly customizable.
    *   **Implementation:** Used to display the list of popular profiles, allowing for smooth scrolling and efficient view recycling. It's also used for managing the list of user-created profiles, enabling users 
            to create, edit, and delete them.
*   **Paging Library:**
    *   **Reason:** Efficiently loads and displays large datasets in pages, improving performance and user experience.
